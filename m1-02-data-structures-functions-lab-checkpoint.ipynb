Introduce realistic variation, such as a few categories that appear more frequently and occasional missing or malformed resolution_minutes values to simulate dirty data.\n",

    "Create small functions that validate the dataset. For example, write one function that checks whether all required keys are present in each record, and another function that identifies records with missing or invalid resolution_minutes. These functions should return clear results such as a list of bad records or counts of issues.\n",

    "Write a function that takes the raw records and returns a cleaned version. At minimum, it should handle missing resolution_minutes values in a defined way and normalize category strings (such as trimming whitespace and standardizing case). If you introduced malformed values, decide whether to drop those records or repair them, and document the decision in a short markdown cell.\n",
